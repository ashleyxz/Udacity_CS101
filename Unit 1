#Quiz 1
print 24*7*7

# Quiz 6
# Given the variables s and t defined as:
s = 'udacity'
t = 'bodacious'
# write Python code that prints out udacious
# without using any quote characters in
# your code.

print s[0:3]+t[4:]

print s[:5]+t[6:]

#Second Solution
print s[:-2]
print t[-3:]
print s[:-2]+t[-3:]

#Quiz 7
# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the first occurrence of 'hoo'
# in the value of text, or -1 if
# it does not occur at all.

text = "first hoo" 

# ENTER CODE BELOW HERE

print text.find('hoo')

#Quiz 8
# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the second occurrence of 'zip'
# in text, or -1 if it does not occur
# at least twice.

# The Python code should be general enough
# to pass every possible case where 'zip' 
# can occur in a string

# Here are two example test cases:
#text = 'all zip files are zipped' 
# >>> 18
# text = 'all zip files are compressed'
# >>> -1

text = "all zip files are zipped" 

# ENTER CODE BELOW HERE
start_zip=text.find('zip')

print text.find('zip',start_zip+1)

#Second Solution
print text.find('zip',text.find('zip')+1)

# IMPORTANT BEFORE SUBMITTING: 
# You should only have one print command in your function

#Quiz 9
# Given a variable, x, that stores the 
# value of any decimal number, write Python 
# code that prints out the nearest whole 
# number to x.
# If x is exactly half way between two 
# whole numbers, round up, so
# 3.5 rounds to 4 and 2.5 rounds to 3.
# You may assume x is not negative.

# Hint: The str function can convert any number into a string.
# eg str(89) converts the number 89 to the string '89'

# Along with the str function, this problem can be solved 
# using just the information introduced in unit 1.

# x = 3.14159 
# >>> 3 (not 3.0)
# x = 27.63 
# >>> 28 (not 28.0)
# x = 3.5 
# >>> 4 (not 4.0)

x = 3.14159

#ENTER CODE BELOW HERE
x = 3.14159
num=x
s=str(num)
point=s.find('.')
print s[:point]
